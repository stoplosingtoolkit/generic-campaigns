					Here's the key if you're a manager getting 
					ready to take some time off:
					<p>
					Plan your vacation, then let staffers run the show. 
					<p>
					Some managers and business owners skipped 
					their vacations last year (and maybe the year 
					before) because they felt the operation couldn't 
					run without them. It's not a good idea for 
					several reasons.
					<p>
					First, everyone needs time off to relax and 
					recharge. 
					<p>
					Second, those who are next in line to run the 
					business become disappointed because you 
					apparently have no faith in them.
					<p>
					When you finally take time off, really take it. 
					Don't work all day on your BlackBerry, advises 
					writer Carol Hymowitz. 
					<p>
					One retired CEO says managers should not make 
					themselves indispensible. Managers should take 
					a week or two off instead of three-day weekends. 
					The people in place to run the show while they're 
					gone have been trained to do it and should have 
					the opportunity to show that they can. 
					<p>
					That doesn't mean managers should be out of touch 
					completely. Emergencies still require attention. 
					Just decide what they really are.
